compile_delta_at_confluence.ipynb

compile_bay_potw.ipynb
  Notebook - this single notebook handles the steps of converting units and corrections
  to source data (primarily Loading Study data), and writing out an intermediate csv file.
  Pretty sure this is actively used.  HDR data appears to be handled as a separate file, 
  rather than merged into each discharger's CSV.
