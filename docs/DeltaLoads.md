## Data Sources for Delta Loads

Locations and loads for POTWs in the Delta are chosen based on applicability to a Suisun Bay/Delta hydrodynamic model.
Outfalls beyond the Delta are folded into boundary condition loads, based on observations when possible.

<a href='http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/rwqcb5/water_issues/drinking_water_policy/dwp_wastewtr_cntrl_meas_stdy.pdf'>This waterboard report</a>
includes a list of Region 5 dischargers, with regional annotations and representative flow rates.  The following POTWs 
are pulled from that list, limited to discharges with >5 mgd average dry weather flow. 
<a href="https://ciwqs.waterboards.ca.gov/ciwqs/readOnly/CiwqsReportServlet?inCommand=reset&reportName=RegulatedFacility">This database</a> also has been useful in searching for these data.

### Lodi
 * 6.3 mgd
 * <A href="http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/centralvalley/board_decisions/adopted_orders/san_joaquin/r5-2013-0125.pdf">NPDES</a>
permit. 
 * They are allowed year-round discharge of tertiary treated wastewater to Dredgerâ€™s Cut,
but typically only discharge Sept through June, and uses the effluent the rest of the time on fields.

### Manteca
 * 5.7 mgd. 
 * <a href="http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/centralvalley/board_decisions/adopted_orders/san_joaquin/r5-2004-0028.pdf">NPDES</a>
permit.

### Sacramento Regional
 * 147 mgd.
 * <a href="http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/rwqcb5/board_decisions/adopted_orders/sacramento/r5-2010-0114-01.pdf">NPDES</a> permit
 * Note that there are large changes ahead for Sac Regional, with a switch to biological nutrient removal by May 2021, which could halve the nutrient outputs and shift the bulk of nitrogen loading to nitrate.
 
### Stockton
 * 28 mgd
 * <A href="https://ciwqs.waterboards.ca.gov/ciwqs/readOnly/PublicAttachmentRetriever?parentID=396967&attachmentID=1464186&attType=3">NPDES</a>
 * Upgraded to tertiary treatment in June 2007, and plans to upgrade to denitrification by June 2024.
 
### Tracy
 * 7.1 mgd
 * <A href="https://ciwqs.waterboards.ca.gov/ciwqs/readOnly/PublicAttachmentRetriever?parentID=388803&attachmentID=1157386&attType=3">NPDES</a>
 * Two outfalls are listed, but they are close to each other, both on Old River.
 
 ### Davis
  * 5.9 mgd
  * <a href="http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/centralvalley/board_decisions/adopted_orders/yolo/r5-2007-0132-02.pdf">NPDES</a> permit
  * Secondary treatment, permitted to 7.5 mgd.
  * Two outfalls, Willow Slough Bypass and Conaway Ranch Toe Drain, fairly close to each other, with 001 on a significantly larger waterway.
  
### UC Davis
 * 3.6 mgd
 * <a href="http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/rwqcb5/board_decisions/adopted_orders/solano/r5-2014-0152.pdf">NPDES</a> permit.
 * Tertiary treatment.
 * Two outfalls, but 002 (Arboretum Waterway) discharges into a disconnected channel which is then pumped upstream of 001 in South Fork Putah Creek.  I believe this then flows into the Yolo Bypass.
 
### Vacaville
 * 8.2 mgd
 * <a href="http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/centralvalley/board_decisions/adopted_orders/solano/r5-2014-0072.pdf">NPDES</a> permit
 * Releases to Alamo Creek, travels to Cache Slough
 
### Woodland
 * 5.6 mgd
 * <a href="https://ciwqs.waterboards.ca.gov/ciwqs/readOnly/PublicAttachmentRetriever?parentID=398643&attachmentID=1520285&attType=3">NPDES</a> permit.
 * Discharges into Tule Canal
 * Permitted and design capacity 10.4 mgd, dry weather
 * While close to the Sacramento, this appears to run down Tule Canal, joining with Prospect slough, then paralleling the deep water ship channel, eventually reaching the stair steps, Holland Tract, and Liberty Island.
