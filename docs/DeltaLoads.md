## Data Sources for Delta Loads

Locations and loads for POTWs in the Delta are chosen based on applicability to a Suisun Bay/Delta hydrodynamic model.
Outfalls beyond the Delta are folded into boundary condition loads, based on observations when possible.

This waterboard report

includes a list of Region 5 dischargers, with regional annotations and representative flow rates.  The following POTWs 
are pulled from that list, limited to discharges with >5 mgd average dry weather flow.

### Lodi
 * 6.3 mgd
 * <A href="http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/centralvalley/board_decisions/adopted_orders/san_joaquin/r5-2013-0125.pdf">NPDES</a>
permit. 
 * They are allowed year-round discharge of tertiary treated wastewater to Dredgerâ€™s Cut,
but typically only discharge Sept through June, and uses the effluent the rest of the time on fields.

### Manteca
 * 5.7 mgd. 
 * <a href="http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/centralvalley/board_decisions/adopted_orders/san_joaquin/r5-2004-0028.pdf">NPDES</a>
permit.

### Sacramento Regional
 * 147 mgd.
 * <a href="http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/rwqcb5/board_decisions/adopted_orders/sacramento/r5-2010-0114-01.pdf">NPDES</a> permit
 * Note that there are large changes ahead for Sac Regional, with a switch to biological nutrient removal by May 2021, which could halve the nutrient outputs and shift the bulk of nitrogen loading to nitrate.
